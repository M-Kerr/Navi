Code below is the MapboxGL example using their CheapRuler QML object

 Figure out how CheapRuler.currentDistance works

 Figure out how the Pre-warn loop inside onCurrentDistanceChanged works.
   - The instructions for the next segment's maneuver is loaded according to
     some ratio between the vehicles speed and distance to next segment.

                   ruler.currentDistance = 0;

                   currentDistanceAnimation.stop();

        Set the CheapRuler's currentPosition to GPS position
           coordinate: ruler.currentPosition

               var i = 0;

            // XXX: Use car speed in meters to pre-warn the turn instruction

                while (

                        // while the accumulated total - vehicle's speed is < Distance traveled
                        total - mapWindow.carSpeed < ruler.currentDistance * 1000

                        // while i < the number of segments in the route
                        && i < routeModel.get(0).segments.length
                ) {
                    // total == the distance to the next instruction after each maneuver
                    total += routeModel.get(0).segments[i++].maneuver.distanceToNextInstruction;
                }

                turnInstructions.text = routeModel.get(0).segments[i - 1].maneuver.instructionText;
           }
       }
